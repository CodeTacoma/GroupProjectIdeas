This repo can be used as a discussion with regards to the first group project Code Tacoma decides to work on.  

If you would like to be added as a contributor(ideas or code), please shoot an email to codetacoma@gmail.com which will allow us to invite you to our Slack channel as well.  We are learning as we go so please tell us if there is a more efficient/elegant way to go about this project or our GH repo in general, we want to hear your suggestions.

For now new ideas can be submitted with pull requests or simply emailing the address above, please tell us if you feel there is a better way to go about idea gathering and we will certainly consider it.  Thank you!
